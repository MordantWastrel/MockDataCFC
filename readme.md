MockData CFC
===

This is a ColdFusion version of the [MockData](https://github.com/cfjedimaster/mockdata) Node.js service
I built sometime ago. Unlike the Node version this isn't obviously a service on its own. Rather, you simply
copy the CFC to your web server (with ColdFusion installed) and then call it from your client-side code or
other scripts. The full docs for how this works may be found on the Node.js version, but as an example, this
call will return 10 random names:

http://localhost:8501/mock/mockdata.cfc?person=name

Notice that you do not need to pass either the method or return type. The CFC automatically selects
the mock method and automatically returns JSON. 

MockData CFC requires ColdFusion 11. And ponies.
